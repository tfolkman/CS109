Can work well for hard to reach populations (e.g. drug users); if you know a node is a drug user then maybe more likely his connections are as well. You maybe finding the more important nodes faster this way (they have more connections). Maybe giving you a better understanding of certain regions of a network, but still maybe missing certain regions.\n",
